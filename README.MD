## CW Lab


CW stands for Continuous Wave. In CW communications, a continuous carrier is transmitted as long as the key contacts are closed. By making and breaking the contacts into specific patterns, characters and entire messages may be sent.



Here is some work about Ham CW, Morse code, by using Nerual Network, Machine Learning method help us learn, recognize the code.

nn_morse, is implemented by pd0wm almost 3 years ago, more details can be found at https://github.com/pd0wm. It works well now, with pyton3.9, pytorch 1.13 + cuda 11.7. It's very useful to broaden vision on the data generating and neural network traning.

morse-dataset is another open source project by souryadey, it's very useful, too. More detailed introduction can be found at https://github.com/souryadey/morse-dataset. He suggests a method to distinguish 0 and 1 in morse code, by using stochastical method.

Also, I'd like to add some features on code generating, then use it with matlab, the new code will be named as nn_morse_2.0.

Just for fun,  keep it simple.
